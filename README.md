Since I can't directly navigate or view external URLs, including GitHub repositories, I'll help you draft a general README file for a project called `ft_transcendence`. You can modify the details as per the actual content and features of the repository:

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waelbt/ft_transcendence.git
   cd ft_transcendence
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Create a database named `ft_transcendence`.
   - Run the database migrations and seeders (if any).

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add necessary configurations (e.g., database URL, secret keys).
